# WiggleAnimation

The `WiggleAnimation` class provides a simple way to apply a wiggling effect to any `View` in an Android application. The animation randomly adjusts the view's translation to create a dynamic and engaging wiggling motion, which can be used for various UI effects.

## Features

- **Customizable Wiggle Factor**: Adjust the intensity of the wiggle effect.
- **Customizable Duration**: Set the duration for each wiggle animation cycle.
- **Automatic Reset**: Resets the view to its original position when the animation stops.
- **Continuous Animation**: The animation continues recursively until stopped.

## Installation

Add the `WiggleAnimation` class to your project.

```java
public class WiggleAnimation {
    // Class implementation
}
